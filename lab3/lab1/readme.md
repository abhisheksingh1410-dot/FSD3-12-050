# EventLoop
- Js is synchronous and single threaded by default

## There can be async behaviour
- with BrowserAPI - setTimeout,setInterval,setImmediate,nextTick
- with promises
- with event handlers

## Promise:
- A function not executed immediately but it must be executed after a while.
- It has some status during the execution.
- At final it may resolve.
- resolve() => success.
- reject() => unsuccess.

## Call back function:
- that pass as argument or the parameter to another function.

# Modern JavaScript is divided into two categories:
- 1) CommonJS (.cjs) => supports OOPS => require 
   - Priority : nextTick,Promise,setImmediate/setTimeout.
- 2) ModuleJS (.mjs) => follow modular approach => import (promise > nextTick)
   - Priority : Promise,nextTick,setTimeout/setImmediate.
